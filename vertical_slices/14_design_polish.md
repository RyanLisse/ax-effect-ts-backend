# Slice 14: Design Polish and Performance
## Objective
Refine UI/UX design to achieve a polished, professional look and optimize performance for production readiness.
## Context
After implementing all core functionality, the final slice focuses on aesthetics, accessibility, and performance. This includes refining the visual design, adding animations, improving responsiveness, and performing stress tests.
## Requirements
- Functional: Review and standardize all pages (chat, pipeline, data explorer, API preview) to ensure consistent typography, spacing, and theming; finalize dark/light modes.
- Functional: Add microinteractions (hover states, smooth transitions) and ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
- Non-functional: Measure bundle size and page load times; optimize code splitting and caching; ensure tests and linting pass.
## Implementation Tasks
1. Visual Polish (Complexity: 4/10)
   - Audit all Tailwind utility classes; extract repeated styles into components or CSS variables.
   - Align with Apple-inspired aesthetic: adjust colours, gradients, shadows; unify icons.
   - Add subtle animations using Framer Motion (e.g., fade-ins, slide transitions).
2. Accessibility & UX (Complexity: 3/10)
   - Ensure all interactive elements have focus styles and aria labels.
   - Provide keyboard navigation for modals, lists, and forms.
   - Add screen reader announcements for streaming messages and errors.
3. Performance Optimization (Complexity: 4/10)
   - Use React.lazy/Suspense and dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle.
   - Audit dependencies; remove unused packages; enable Treeshaking.
   - Use Next.js static generation or caching where possible.
4. Testing & DoD (Complexity: 3/10)
   - Add visual regression tests (e.g., via Chromatic or Storybook).
   - Ensure Lighthouse scores meet performance targets (â‰¥ 90 for performance/accessibility).
   - Verify all slice tests pass and the project builds without errors.
## Implementation Details
// This slice is mostly design; no major code sample needed. Use CSS variables and Tailwind theme.
## Error Handling
- Ensure fallback UI for network errors; provide offline message.
- Provide skeleton loaders for slow components.
## Testing
- Execute final E2E tests covering all major flows.
- Run Lighthouse and fix any accessibility/performance issues.
