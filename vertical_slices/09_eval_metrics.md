# Slice 9: Evaluation & Observability
## Objective
Provide tools to evaluate RAG performance and to monitor the system with metrics and traces.
## Context
To ensure reliability and improvement, we need a way to measure the quality of answers and observe system performance. This slice implements an evaluation harness for test questions and sets up observability through logs, metrics, and traces.
## Requirements
- Functional: Implement an eval CLI that loads questions/answers and outputs accuracy, groundedness, and latency metrics.
- Functional: Expose Prometheus metrics for query counts, latencies, and errors; add structured logging and optional tracing.
- Non-functional: Integrate evaluation into CI; provide dashboards for metrics.
## Implementation Tasks
1. Eval CLI (Complexity: 4/10)
   - Write a Node CLI (e.g., using Commander) that loads a dataset (CSV/JSON) of questions and expected answers; runs queries through the pipeline and measures metrics.
   - Compute accuracy@k, F1, and groundedness by comparing citations.
2. Observability Setup (Complexity: 5/10)
   - Integrate a logger (e.g., Pino) with structured logs for each pipeline stage.
   - Expose a `/metrics` endpoint using Prometheus client; define counters and histograms.
   - Optionally add OpenTelemetry traces around retrieval and generation.
3. CI Integration (Complexity: 2/10)
   - Add evaluation script to CI pipeline; fail if regression detected.
   - Deploy metrics to monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana) via Kubernetes.
## Implementation Details
```
// cli/eval.ts
import { Command } from 'commander';
const program = new Command();
program.option('-f, --file <path>', 'QA dataset');
program.action(async (options) => {
  // load dataset, call API, compute metrics...
});
program.parse();
```
## Error Handling
- Handle file read errors; display usage instructions when dataset missing.
- Ensure metric endpoints handle high cardinality gracefully.
## Testing
- Unit tests for metric definitions and eval metric computations.
- Integration tests executing eval CLI on a small dataset with a mocked API.
